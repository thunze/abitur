# Utopian and dystopian society

## Characteristics of a dystopian society

- people need to accomplish **senseless tasks**
- treatment of humankind as **scientific objects** / dehumanized state
- fear of the outside world
- society as an illusion of a perfect utopian world
- worshipping of a figurehead or concept
- distrust and banishment of the natural world
- uniformity / homogeneity

## Organ donation

- **reasons:** cells get weak / infected, esp. *vital organs*
- **organs that can be transplanted:** kidneys, pancreas, liver, lungs etc.
- **problems – recipient:** graft rejection (immune system issue), organ loses its function, chance of death
- **problems – donor:** health issues after donation, relatives / health insurance agreement (you need an organ donor card)
	- better solution: people can only **explicitly revoke** the permission to transplant organs after death
