# Utopian and dystopian society

## Characteristics of a dystopian society

- people need to accomplish **senseless tasks**
- treatment of humankind as **scientific objects** / dehumanized state
- fear of the outside world
- society as an illusion of a perfect utopian world
- worshipping of a figurehead or concept
- distrust and banishment of the natural world
- uniformity / homogeneity

## Organ donation

- **reasons:** cells get weak / infected, esp. *vital organs*
- **organs that can be transplanted:** kidneys, pancreas, liver, lungs etc.
- **problems – recipient:** graft rejection (immune system issue), organ loses its function, chance of death
- **problems – donor:** health issues after donation, relatives / health insurance agreement (you need an organ donor card)
	- better solution: people can only **explicitly revoke** the permission to transplant organs after death

## Elements of dystopian literature: *Never Let Me Go*

- **human clones are created so that they can donate their organs to their *originals* as young adults**
- everything is controlled by a kind of government
- clones' lives are heavily restricted, e. g. they are not allowed to go outside there destined area
- indoctrination happens so that they don't become rebellious **> limited knowledge**
- clones are satisfied with **senseless tasks** they need to accomplish
	- **clones can't develop a healthy social life**
- **three parts:** Hailsham (a kind of boarding school), the Cottages, Ruth's life as a so-called *carer*
	- *carer:* people who take care of donors at some kind of "hospitals"
- follows the life from the perpective of the protagonsist **Ruth**
- **Ruth** is the best friend of **Kathy** although they sometimes have arguments because of silly things in the beginning, maybe because they can't develop a healthy social life
- **Tommy** also is a friend of both, **Ruth** gets together with him before attending the Cottages
- later on – after they've broken up – **Ruth** seems to be jealous of **Kathy** because of her good connection to **Tommy**
	- this leaves **Kathy** sad, so she starts her training as a *carer*
- after *caring* for **Ruth** and **Tommy**, she also starts donating organs
	- this is actually reflected in present tense in the novel, the rest is presented as a **flashback**
