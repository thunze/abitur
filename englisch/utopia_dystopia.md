## Organ donation

- **reasons:** cells get weak / infected, esp. *vital organs*
- **organs that can be transplanted:** kidneys, pancreas, liver, lungs etc.
- **problems – recipient:** graft rejection (immune system issue), organ loses its function, chance of death
- **problems – donor:** health issues after donation, relatives / health insurance agreement (you need an organ donor card)
